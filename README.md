# Friendly Chatbot

This project creates a chatbot that interacts with the user in a friendly and conversational manner. It asks questions like "How are you doing?" and delves into various topics, mimicking a friend's chat style.

**Running the Chatbot:**

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `chatbot` directory.
3. Run the script using `python chatbot.py`.

**Components:**

- `error_handling.py`: Manages potential errors during user input.
- `chatbot.py`: Implements the chatbot's logic and conversation flow.
- `data.json`: Stores conversation topics and responses.

## Usage

- Type your messages after the `You:` prompt and press Enter.
- Type `exit` to end the conversation.

**Customization:**
Feel free to modify the data in `data.json` to personalize the chatbot's conversation style and topics.
